# Estimation on the Percentage of pixels loaded in
### The Roblox Community of America

## abstract
In this paper we compute the amount of overloading that is occurring on Earth.

## introduction 
Overloading is the amount of pixels loaded in at any given time compared to what is actually required for operation.

## results
From our research we found that 3x as many pixels are loaded on earth at any time compared to what needs to be.

## conclusions
That's a lot. We should lower that.
